# Handshake Project for Internship - Chirps
---

Submitted by: **Mariela Hernandez**

Time Spent: ~**3** hours spent in total


This is the project I made for the coding portion of the Handshake interview!

## How to Set Up Project


## Install Guide
Please have the following on your local computer:
- using Ruby 2.4.2
- using Rails 5.2.4
- bundle install
- rails db:migrate
- rails server


## How I prioritized my time
- I spent ~10 minutes reading the prompt
- I spent ~15 minutes understanding the different terms brought up in the prompt + googling different resources.
- I spent ~15 minutes writing the README
- I spent ~2 hours writing the code
- I spent the rest of the time debugging and trying to add extra features

## Work Completed

The following **additional** features would be done later:




## Assumptions


## Database Information

As per the prompt, the database has a single table called "chirps"

The chirps table has two columns:
1. id (primary key)
2. text (string)


## Extra Notes
- I wanted to design the way this web application would look like if I were to fully flesh out the project. I drew up a low fidelity sketch of my initial thought, and used Figma to build on this idea.

While the submission I gave was not exactly like my hi-fidelity prototype, this is the design spec that I came up with and would work on with more time.
